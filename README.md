# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project 🚀

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:
![Data Architecture](https://github.com/abdelrhmanashraf103/sql-data-warehouse-project/blob/master/sql-datawarehouse-project/docs/data_architecture.png)
- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
- **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
- **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

- **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

This repository is an excellent resource for professionals and students looking to showcase expertise in:

- SQL Development
- Data Architecture
- Data Engineering
- ETL Pipeline Development

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications**
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

**Objective**
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- Customer Behavior
- Product Performance  
- Sales Trends

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
